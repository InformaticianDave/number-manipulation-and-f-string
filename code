#keeps printing out to almost every decimal
print(8 / 3)
#by using the int function, you basically turn it into a whole number
print(int(8 / 3))
#by using the round function, with the '2' at the end you basically round it by '2' decimal places.
print(round(8 / 3, 2))
#by using the '//' or floor division, basically it becomes an integer,so a whole number chopping off all the numbers after the decimal in place.
print(8 // 3)
#if you check the data type, it's an integer
print(type(8 // 3))
#Another thing you can do is to continue performing calculations on a variable. So for example, I could do 4 / 2, which is going to be equal to 2. But then if I want to divide it by the 2 again, I could actually say result /= 2. And when I now print results, I'll actually get 1 because it's 4 / 2 then divided by 2 again.
result = 4 / 2
result /=2
print(result)
#If you're keeping track of the user's score, so you could have score = 0 to begin with and every single time in your code say a user scores a point, then you can get hold of this score variable again and instead of saying score now equals the previous value of score plus one, you can simply use this shorthand, +=, so +=1. And now when we print score, you'll see that it's actually equal to 1. So instead of using +=, you can use -=, which just takes the previous version of score and removes 1 from it.
score = 0
  #User scores a point
score += 10
score += 10
score -= 4
score *= 2
score /= 2
print(score)
#ez way to turn any data types to another type; by using something called f-string
red = 0
height = 1.8
isWinning = True

print(f"The red team score is {red}, The red team's height is {height}, The team is Winning {isWinning}")
